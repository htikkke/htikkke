                BLACKPINK Lisa Finally Announced Her Contract With YG Entertainment.
                As we know, BLACKPINK is currently in the process of renewing their exclusive contract with YG
                Entertainment.

                Including Lisa's contract with YG Entertainment which is currently being discussed by all the media

                that Lisa has reportedly rejected a 50 billion won contract from YG Entertainment.

                This has made fans curious about the future of the group.

                There has been no official announcement regarding BLACKPINK's contract extension at the Final Concert,

                but what Jennie said at the concert put fans at ease as she said

                " We'll continue to be amazing ... BLACKPINK will continue to work hard and show their cool side in the
                future".
                Meanwhile, Dentiste Thailand, the brand that Lisa has represented as their brand ambassador 0:49
                provided information regarding Lisa's contract with YG Entertainment. 0:54 Dentiste Thailand wrote in
                the caption 'To the infinity, wherever you go we will support you' . 1:01 The caption made fans feel
                anxious about what decision Lisa had made. 1:07 Fans suspect that Lisa may have failed to renew her
                contract with YG Entertainment. 1:14 As loyal fans, we must accept every decision Lisa makes in the

                On october 9, Jisoo has landed safely at ICN airport from London. Despite a long flight
                and being surrounded by chaos at the airport, Jisoo still appeared cheerful and radiant. She
                continuously waved at fans, accepting gifts from them with a smile that never left her lips. In
                addition to Jisoo's friendly demeanor and smiling eyes, her airport outfit also attracted a lot of
                attention, but in an entirely different way. Despite the hot weather in Seoul, Jisoo looked
                quite warm in her oversized coat and beanie. When fans noticed her weather-inappropriate outfit,
                Jisoo cutely expressed frustration, feeling she had relied too much on incorrect information

                In a recent video titled 'BLACKPINK's Contract Speculations' on 'Entertainment President Lee Jin-ho's
                YouTube channel,' Lee Jin-ho discussed Lisa's contract value.

                As BLACKPINK marks its 7th anniversary, contract renewals with YG Entertainment are ongoing. Rumors
                circulate about members leaving, though no confirmations have been made.

                Lee Jin-ho noted YG's commitment to support BLACKPINK's activities, despite potential individual
                contracts. Changing dynamics among members make renewals challenging.

                Lisa's recent move performing at Crazy Horse in Paris raised questions. Lee Jin-ho speculated her
                actions might indicate uncertainty about her YG contract.

                Addressing a rumored 50 billion won offer from a Thai company, Lee Jin-ho emphasized Lisa's global role,
                estimating her contract value at over 50 billion won, possibly 100 billion. YG faces challenges
                retaining her.

                Lee Jin-ho discussed potential group and individual contracts, hinting at BLACKPINK's future as a group.
                It's likely they'll prioritize individual endeavors in the coming years.
